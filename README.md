## Project Description
Implementation of a Turing Machine and simulation 


## Project semester and year

Fall Semester, 2023

## Running the program

 In the terminal navigate to source code directory and enter the command
   
   ```
   javac tm/*.java
   ```
then run
```
java tm.TMSimulator <Filename>
```
## General Reflection 
### Sean
I found this project was interesting to create the Turing Machine and to try and do it efficiently. For the Tape class I was trying to find the most efficient data structure to use to increase the speed of the program. After some thought and discussion with Kaden we determined that a  modified doubly linked list would be the be the best to use since we only need to at most move 1 direction. Overall the project was fun to work with.
